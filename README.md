## History
-I have chosen to make a page on the history of the club Manchester United due to the fact that it is a vital reason to why it has one the biggest fanbases in every sport.

## Footer
-The footer contains four different social media pages which can be open a link to each website when clicked on.

### Font
-I have used a font from (https://fonts.google.com/)

### Color
-I have mainly used a light red because red is the color of the football club I have made this website on. I have used a lighter red rather then a darker one since it is easier to look at for a longer duration of time and more appealing.

-White and black is also recurring colors since it is very easy to see and bold which is important when reading information.
