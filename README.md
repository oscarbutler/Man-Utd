## Home

- I have made the background of the home page the stadium of Manchester United which is called Old Trafford. This is a very important piece of the club as it is one of the most iconic stadiums in football history. 

- Due to it being called the home page I put the stadium as that is the home of the club.

## History
- I have chosen to make a page on the history of the club Manchester United due to the fact that it is a vital reason to why it has one the biggest fanbases in every sport.

## Footer
- The footer contains four different social media pages which can be open a link to each website when clicked on.

### Font
- I have used a font from (https://fonts.google.com/)

### Color
- I have mainly used a light red because red is the color of the football club I have made this website on. I have used a lighter red rather then a darker one since it is easier to look at for a longer duration of time and more appealing.

- White and black is also recurring colors since it is very easy to see and bold which is important when reading information.
