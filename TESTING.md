## Performance

In the devtools I used the lighthouse report to test the websites performance

(documentation/sc-homepage-performance)

(documentation/sc-history-performance)
documentation/sc-content-performance


(documentation/sc-response-performance)


## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

- The lighthouse performance rating was too low due to the size of the photos being too big.

* Solution

- I found new images which sizes were a lot smaller which made the website load time a lot more efficient

### Unsolved Bugs

### Mistakes

- At the start of this project I found myself often using past tense in my commits which I made sure I would not repeat in the future.

- At the start I also did not specify which file I was commiting and instead comitted them all which made it very deifficult to read the progress I made over time.
