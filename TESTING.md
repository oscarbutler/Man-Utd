# Testing

## Compatability

The different browsers I have chosen to use are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox

![Google Chrome](documentation/google-chrome-test.png)

![Microsoft Edge](documentation/microsoft-edge-test.png)

![Firefox](documentation/firefox-test.png)

This shows that the website is comaptable to a variety of browsers since it is all the same image

## Responsiveness

## Performance

In the devtools I used the lighthouse report to test the websites performance

![Contact Page](documentation/sc-contact-performance.png)

![Response Page](documentation/sc-response-performance.png)


## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

- The lighthouse performance rating was too low due to the size of the photos being too big.

* Solution

- I replaced the images but also had to delete one which went against my plans I made at the start.

### Unsolved Bugs

- None

### Mistakes

- I did not add style to body and main elements from the start which made it harder to create an appealing website

- At the start I also did not specify which file I was commiting and instead comitted them all which made it very deifficult to read the progress I made over time
